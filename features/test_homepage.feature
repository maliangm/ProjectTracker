Feature: Test Homepage
  As this is the initial setup of the dev environment, 
  As a developer
  I as to make sure that the cucumber works normally by testing the old homepage.
  Please delete this feature when you delete the welcome-onboard page.
  
  Scenario: Homepage works fine
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see "Welcome"
